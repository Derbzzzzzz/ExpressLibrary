# ExpressLibrary

This website utilizes Express (Node) and MongoDB and has full CRUD capabilities. The website was made largely in part to following a MDN tutorial. However, certain parts (such as many of the updating and deleting controller functions) weren't given in the tutorial and were made independently.
